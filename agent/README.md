## Builders Fund - Permissionless Index Fund for Web3 Builders

A decentralized index fund that invests in the most promising builders in the Web3 ecosystem. Built for ETHGlobal Cannes hackathon.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Builders Fund is a permissionless index fund that supports builders in the Web3 ecosystem through a tokenized investment strategy. The fund's value is represented by a token that provides diversified exposure to builder tokens selected by AI agents.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Fund Management**: Advanced AI agents analyze and select the most promising builder tokens
- **Diversified Investment**: Spread risk across multiple builder tokens while supporting the Web3 ecosystem
- **Transparent Operations**: All fund decisions and holdings are transparent and verifiable on-chain

## 📊 Fund Mechanics

1. **Builders Launch Tokens**: Builders create personal tokens with minimum liquidity
2. **AI Agent Selection**: AI fund manager analyzes and selects promising builder tokens
3. **Investor Participation**: Buy fund tokens to gain diversified exposure
